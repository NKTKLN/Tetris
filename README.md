# 👾 Tetris

![Preview](assets/preview.png)

One of my favorite games is Tetris. So I dreamed of writing this game sooner or later.  There is an opinion that a person can call himself a programmer only after he has written his own Tetris. And so, finally, I decided to write my own Tetris.

*Additional information:* </br>
Tetris is the most famous computer game invented and programmed by Soviet programmer A. L. Pazhitnov in 1985.
